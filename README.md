# Cybersecurity Desktop Exercise: Strengthening Incident Response and Organizational Resilience
This Cybersecurity Desktop Exercise is a structured, multi-day scenario designed to test and enhance an organizationâ€™s ability to detect, respond to, and recover from significant cyber incidents. It focuses on improving coordination, communication, and decision-making across teams when faced with escalating cyberattacks on both IT administrative systems and operational systems.

The exercise unfolds in phases, simulating a timeline where threats evolve day by day, challenging participants to think critically about their actions, decisions, and strategies as the situation develops. Each day presents new challenges and questions, prompting teams to evaluate how and why they should respond based on the evolving scenario.

Participants are guided through three key modules: Threat and Initial Incident, Incident Escalation, and Post-Incident Recovery. These modules encourage teams to assess detection methods, containment strategies, and recovery plans while reflecting on organizational strengths and areas for improvement.

The exercise is conducted in an open, no-fault environment, allowing participants to discuss potential responses, test existing plans, and explore solutions without fear of failure. It emphasizes adaptability, collaboration, and preparedness, ensuring that lessons learned during the exercise can be directly applied to real-world incidents.

With additional resources such as real-world case studies, threat explanations, and preparedness tools provided in the appendices, this exercise equips organizations with the insights needed to refine incident response plans, strengthen resilience, and safeguard critical assets and services.
